Some of the bonds formed were almost instantaneous, while others took time to grow. The first group I gravitated towards was, unsurprisingly, those who shared my mother tongue—Tamil. We didn't need an elaborate reason to connect. The familiar language created an unspoken bond. Then there was my second group, my Electrical Engineering (EE) batchmates, who I'll call The Dope Squad, became another close circle of friends. At first, we were all trying to figure out some ways to tackle this notoriously challenging course, and we leaned on each other for notes, explanations, and sometimes, assignments :)",

His reputation preceded him, and it was clear that he meant business. To our astonishment, Professor Y announced that he would be conducting an exam right then and there. The entire class was caught off guard. The results were nothing short of brutal. Almost everyone got a zero. Somehow, I had managed to score a 10 on 10 (Yes, am bragging). I took it as a small victory in an otherwise humbling experience.",
