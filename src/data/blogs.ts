For my 11th and 12th grades, I attended Paavai Vidhyashram School, where the pressure of JEE preparation intensified. Despite facing health issues during my 12th class, I managed to secure a rank of 1255 in JEE Advanced.',

The idea of studying at one of these prestigious institutions became an obsession. Despite the health issues I faced in 12th grade, my hard work paid off when I achieved a rank of 1255 in JEE Advanced.
